# teal-cli

A new cli to the [Teal](https://github.com/teal-language/tl) compiler

# Commands

 - `check`: type check one or more Teal files
 - `gen`: type check and compile one or more Teal files
 - `run`: type check and run a Teal script in a sandbox
 - `build`: build a project based on `tlconfig.lua`

# API

The output of all the commands is much nicer for humans than it is for computers. If you'd like the output of commands, or to be able to load a `tlconfig.lua` in your own tooling, we provide a small api.
